So, you haven't read the tiny light blue GitHub hyperlinks, and you maybe wondering, 'Where did all my commits go'?

Just like all apples are not created equal, nor are all contributions.

 Here's a simple list to get your work to show off in the form of those cute tiny tiles:

###Issues pull requests and commits:

Will show up as a tile on your graph, if it was made within the past year, and  opened in a stand alone repository, not in a fork.

###For Commit Contributions to appear on your tile graph:

1. The  email  address used for your commits is connected to your GitHub account.

2. Commits were made in the repositories default branch ('master'). Commits for Repos with Project Pages sites are made in gh-pages.
=
3. One of the following must also be true:

- You have forked the repository

- You have starred the repository

- You have opened a pull request or an issue on the repository

- You are either a collaborator of the repository or a member of the organization
